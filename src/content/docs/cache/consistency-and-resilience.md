title: Consistency and resilience
description: Choose what a read must observe and which transient failures may reuse a stale value.
---

In Astilba Cache, consistency controls what a read must observe. Resilience controls which failures may reuse a previously good value. They are related, but they are not the same switch.

The **Registry** is the authoritative invalidation record, the **Bus** delivers its updates to active instances, and **L2** is the shared Store used for values and recovery data. See [Cache fundamentals](/docs/cache/core-concepts/) for the complete vocabulary.

These consistency levels become meaningful when <code>Registry</code>, <code>Bus</code>, and <code>L2</code> are configured together. L2 holds values and the durable recovery mirror; <code>createCache()</code> refuses a Registry-plus-Bus reader without it. Without the coordinated invalidation path, the current kernel treats decoded entries as fresh and <code>consistency</code> does not create a live check.

## Choose a consistency level

| Level | Current behavior | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Eventual — default | Uses verified local invalidation knowledge. Unknown or suspect knowledge follows the configured unknown policy. | Usually no Registry round trip on a warm, known hit. Conservative misses or checks occur while knowledge reconverges. |
| Strong — opt in | Performs a live, un-memoized Registry check before serving a stored entry and before running the factory for a miss. A soft-stale value is refilled in the foreground instead of returned through the eventual stale path. | Adds authoritative coordination to stored-entry reads and fills, and surfaces Registry failures. |

Choose strong mode with <code>consistency: "strong"</code> on the call or in <code>defaults.consistency</code>. A per-call option wins; when neither is present, the read is eventual.

- Unknown or suspect knowledge never validates an entry as fresh or grace-servable by itself.
- A hard invalidation observed during a fill can fence the result. When verified knowledge advanced, the kernel re-mints the birth epoch and may refetch within a three-attempt budget before surfacing <code>FencedError</code> or a miss entry.

On a strong miss, the pre-factory live check establishes the current Registry epoch from the canonical key, namespace, and caller-declared tags. Tags discovered later through <code>FactoryCtx</code> join the final stored set and write-back fence. They were not available for individual pre-checking, but a delivered hard purge on one during the fill can still fence and retry the result.

Strong mode may still use an eligible stale candidate when its foreground factory fails with a classified transient error and the call declared <code>grace</code>. It rechecks the candidate at serve time; a hard-dead or still-unknown value is not served.

## Decide what unknown means

Set <code>defaults.unknownPolicy</code> for eventual reads:

| Policy | Result |
| --- | --- |
| <code>registry-check</code> — default | Ask the Registry for live tag watermarks. If the check cannot establish safety, the read fails closed. |
| <code>miss</code> | Treat the entry as unusable and continue to the fill path. |
| <code>error</code> | Throw <code>UnknownTagError</code> with the user tags whose safety could not be established. The factory does not run. |

<code>takedownSensitive: true</code>, at the top level or inside <code>defaults</code>, selects that same throwing posture. If either level is <code>true</code>, a <code>false</code> value at the other level does not cancel it. It is a safety override and therefore outranks even an explicit <code>unknownPolicy</code>; use it when refilling unknown content could resurrect material under a takedown or legal embargo.

The source Workers factory explicitly chooses <code>registry-check</code>. Its request-driven carrier helps future eventual reads reconverge, but it never turns unverified knowledge into a current-read hit; a read that is still suspect follows the fail-closed policy immediately.

## Choose the strong-outage posture

By default, a failed Registry check for a strong read throws <code>RegistryUnavailableError</code>. Configure <code>defaults.onUnavailable: "eventual"</code> to degrade only that call to eventual rules instead:

~~~ts
const cache = createCache({
  namespace: "storefront",
  clock,
  rng,
  l2,
  registry,
  bus,
  defaults: {
    consistency: "strong",
    onUnavailable: "eventual",
  },
  telemetry: sink,
})
~~~

The degradation emits <code>strong_degraded</code> with reason <code>registry_unreachable</code>. Eventual does not mean “serve whatever is stored”: the call still uses verified local knowledge and the configured unknown policy. Use this opt-out only when that conservative eventual posture is acceptable during a Registry outage.

Store availability is separate from Registry availability. A classified <code>throttled</code> or <code>unavailable</code> Store read emits <code>store_read_suppressed</code> and behaves as a tier miss; an L1 hit may therefore absorb an L2 outage, while a call without another usable tier proceeds to its factory. Unclassified Store errors still propagate unchanged.

## Serve stale data only for classified failures

A failed factory does not modify a stored good value. A transient failure may reuse a stale candidate only after the candidate is revalidated at serve time.

~~~ts title="loader.ts"
import { httpError } from "@astilba/cache"

export async function loadProduct(url: URL) {
  const response = await fetch(url)

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw httpError(response)
  }

  return response.json()
}
~~~

The default <code>isRetriableHttp()</code> classifier accepts:

- any <code>TypeError</code>, intended to cover fetch and network rejections;
- cache-originated <code>CacheTimeoutError</code> values;
- HTTP 408, 425, 429, 500, 502, 503, and 504;
- Cloudflare 520–527 and 530 responses.

Caller-originated timeouts and fact-like HTTP responses such as 403, 404, and 410 are not retriable by default. Replace the classifier with <code>defaults.staleIfError</code> when your application has a different failure vocabulary.

Cache invokes that classifier only when the call declares <code>grace</code>. Compatible singleflight callers share origin work, but a transient shared failure does not erase the stale candidate each caller read before joining. If the factory-running call had no candidate, a waiting caller with its own eligible candidate can still revalidate and serve it; a caller with no candidate propagates the failure. A hard purge observed before serve-time revalidation makes the candidate ineligible.

## Keep facts visible

Negative entries are never served through grace or stale-on-error. Declaring <code>notFoundTtl</code> allows an <code>HttpError</code> with status 404 to take the negative L2 path. A negative fill and a later read that reaches the invalidation-fresh negative resolve the fact as <code>undefined</code>, never as the internal stored placeholder.

The singleflight outcome depends first on what the factory-running caller observed and whether the compatible calls declared <code>grace</code>. If the leader has a grace-eligible, still-servable stale value, it suppresses the negative write and its value and evidence become the shared outcome for every compatible joiner. If that candidate revalidates as dead or unknown, it writes and serves the negative as the shared result; no caller may fall back to a candidate that cannot be established servable. If the factory-running caller has no grace-eligible candidate, it makes the negative L2 write attempt once inside the shared fill window and shares the not-found fact. Only in that leader-without-a-candidate case does each waiter use its own earlier read: a waiter that declared <code>grace</code> and observed a still-servable stale value returns it, while a waiter without one returns <code>undefined</code>. Without <code>grace</code>, every compatible caller takes the negative disposition even if it observed a stale value. Serve-time validation may instead throw <code>RegistryUnavailableError</code> under the configured unavailable posture. Waiters do not write the fact again.

The negative is not copied into L1. Cache best-effort deletes an older L1 value after attempting to record the fact in L2. If that deletion fails, the older L1 copy can still win a later tier read until it is evicted or overwritten.

:::caution[Durations are not enforced]
The presence of <code>grace</code> currently opts a stale candidate into error fallback, but elapsed grace is not measured. Likewise, <code>notFoundTtl</code> opts into a negative entry without expiring it after the declared duration. Entry <code>age</code> is measured from the served envelope's <code>bornMs</code> fill-start timestamp, but TTL and grace still do not consume that elapsed time.

An eventual soft-stale read also awaits its refresh in the current implementation, then returns the stale value. Background adoption, queue retry, and refresh completion tracking are not yet present.

Use <code>cache.explain(key)</code> to inspect the current local verdict and reader state without changing it. The method performs no live Registry check or resynchronization, so it is useful for diagnosis but never a substitute for a strong read. See [Inspect cache behavior](/docs/cache/observability/).
