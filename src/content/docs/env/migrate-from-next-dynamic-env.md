title: Migrate from next-dynamic-env
description: Replace next-dynamic-env proxies and script injection with an explicit Env contract and generated application boundaries.
---

Astilba Env covers the build-once deployment use case of [`next-dynamic-env`](https://github.com/ReesMorris/next-dynamic-env), but it does not preserve that package's API or runtime mechanism. The migration replaces ambient proxies and script injection with an explicit contract, generated browser and server modules, and application-owned inert JSON delivery.

Treat this as an architectural migration, not a package rename.

## Map the concepts

| `next-dynamic-env` | Astilba Env 0.2 |
| --- | --- |
| `createDynamicEnv({ client, server })` | [`defineEnvironment({ entries, consumers, targets })`](/docs/env/declaration-reference/#defineenvironment) |
| `clientEnv` proxy | Generated browser build configuration or validated bootstrap values |
| `serverEnv` proxy | Generated server target `check` or `load` |
| `DynamicEnvScript` | Application-owned JSON endpoint plus `loadBrowserBootstrap` |
| `waitForEnv` | Await `loadBrowserBootstrap` or use `startBrowserApplication` |
| Inline `window.__NEXT_DYNAMIC_ENV__` value | Inert, same-origin JSON response |
| Validator tuple beside each current value | Lifecycle-aware codec in the declaration |
| Automatic validation skip during `next build` | Explicit build, deployment, and request lifecycles |
| `emptyStringAsUndefined` global option | Per-codec blank, required, and normalisation policy |
| Framework package with one root export | Framework-neutral root, browser, runtime, and Vite boundaries |

There is no `@astilba/env/next` export. App Router and Pages Router integrations use application code around the same generated modules.

## Replace the runtime declaration

A `next-dynamic-env` declaration reads current values while it constructs `clientEnv` and `serverEnv`. An Env declaration describes values without reading them:

```ts
// astilba.env.ts
import { defineEnvironment, env } from "@astilba/env";

export default defineEnvironment({
  id: "com.example.web",
  entries: {
    apiOrigin: env.public.deployment.origin(),
    applicationOrigin: env.public.deployment.origin(),
    databaseUrl: env.private.deployment.secret(),
    port: env.private.deployment.safeInteger({
      maximum: 65_535,
      minimum: 1,
    }),
  },
  consumers: {
    browser: env.browser(["apiOrigin", "applicationOrigin"]),
    server: env.server(["databaseUrl", "port"]),
  },
  targets: {
    browserDeployment: env.process("browser", {
      apiOrigin: "API_ORIGIN",
      applicationOrigin: "APPLICATION_ORIGIN",
    }),
    serverDeployment: env.process("server", {
      databaseUrl: "DATABASE_URL",
      port: "PORT",
    }),
  },
});
```

Public exposure is determined by both the entry visibility and the browser consumer selection. A variable name does not become public merely because it has a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix.

Generate and check the application-owned interfaces:

```sh
pnpm exec astilba-env generate
pnpm exec astilba-env generate --check
```

## Replace `serverEnv`

Replace ambient proxy access with an explicit generated target:

```ts
import "server-only";

import { load } from "./.astilba/env/serverDeployment.server";

const configuration = load(process.env);

configuration.databaseUrl;
configuration.port;
```

Use `check` where application code needs to choose the failure response. Diagnostics contain stable codes and logical identities where appropriate; they do not echo configuration values.

## Replace browser injection

Remove `DynamicEnvScript`, the mutable `clientEnv` proxy, and `waitForEnv`. Add the application-owned Next.js JSON route and Client Component described in [Next.js](/docs/env/nextjs/).

The replacement has three explicit pieces:

1. a generated server target checks the public source values;
2. the route returns the exact public envelope with `Cache-Control: private, no-store`; and
3. `@astilba/env/browser` validates the same-origin response before dependent UI renders.

Use [Deliver browser configuration](/docs/env/browser-delivery/) when you need the complete framework-neutral protocol and failure behavior.

Do not keep both delivery mechanisms active. Once the JSON bootstrap path passes application tests, remove the inline script and every read from `window.__NEXT_DYNAMIC_ENV__`.

## Understand the validation differences

| Previous behavior | Migration decision |
| --- | --- |
| Validation ran while `createDynamicEnv` built its proxies | Env checks a generated target when your code calls `check` or `load`. |
| Validation was automatically skipped during `next build` | Mark values as `build`, `deployment`, or `request`; there is no automatic Next build bypass. |
| Raw values could be accepted without a schema | Choose an explicit [Env codec](/docs/env/declaration-reference/#built-in-codecs). |
| One global option converted empty strings to missing values | Configure blank and required behavior on each codec. |
| Validator transforms supplied defaults or arbitrary output types | Use a built-in codec, a private opaque schema, or application validation after loading. |
| Validation errors could throw, warn, or call a handler | Use `check` for an explicit result or `load` for an exception. |
| Client and server values lived behind runtime proxies | Generated browser and server modules create a static import boundary. |

The browser projection accepts only Env's portable public codecs. Arbitrary schemas and opaque transforms cannot enter a browser consumer.

## Migrate Yup validation deliberately

Prefer built-in codecs for common configuration:

```ts
entries: {
  enabled: env.public.deployment.boolean(),
  mode: env.public.deployment.enum(["standard", "compact"]),
  origin: env.public.deployment.origin(),
  port: env.private.deployment.safeInteger({
    maximum: 65_535,
    minimum: 1,
  }),
}
```

For a genuinely custom private transform, use an `opaque` entry and pass an exactly typed, synchronous Standard Schema v1 implementation to the generated target. A Yup adapter can wrap `validateSync`; it must translate success or failure into the Standard Schema result without exposing the rejected value.

Read [Validation and Standard Schema](/docs/env/validation-and-standard-schema/) for the exact type, runtime, CLI, and portability limits.

If the Yup schema represents application business rules instead of configuration syntax, load a built-in private value and validate it after the Env boundary.

## Account for intentional non-compatibilities

Env 0.2 does not provide compatibility exports or shims for:

- `createDynamicEnv`;
- `clientEnv` or `serverEnv`;
- `DynamicEnvScript`;
- `waitForEnv`;
- `window.__NEXT_DYNAMIC_ENV__`;
- `__raw`;
- `skipValidation` or automatic build-phase detection;
- `onValidationError`;
- a global `emptyStringAsUndefined` switch;
- implicit `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` exposure; or
- `@astilba/env/next`.

These omissions preserve explicit lifecycles, static artifact boundaries, and inert browser delivery.

## Verify and remove the old package

Before removing `next-dynamic-env`:

1. run `pnpm exec astilba-env generate --check` in CI;
2. fail application startup or the endpoint when a required deployment value is missing;
3. verify browser bundles contain no private entry name, binding name, or value;
4. verify the JSON response has the expected audience and `Cache-Control: private, no-store`;
5. change deployment values without rebuilding and confirm one built artifact observes the new values;
6. exercise successful and rejected bootstrap responses; and
7. remove every import, script component, and global reference from `next-dynamic-env`.

Remove the old dependency only after those checks pass:

```sh
pnpm remove next-dynamic-env
```

The Env package tests exercise App Router and Pages Router builds in static and request modes. Your route, proxy trust, startup policy, and failure UI still require application tests.
